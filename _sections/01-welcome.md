The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) was established in 1998 as an academic project. Long before “open access” was coined, PKP was trying to solve the problem of cost as a barrier to creating and consuming scholarship online. Our team of scholars and students pursued this goal for nearly three years before, in 2001, Open Journal Systems (OJS) was born.

Today, OJS is the world’s most widely used free and open source publishing software, available in more than X languages. We owe this success to our contributors - past, present, and future: librarians, software developers, translators, editors, scholars, and many more from around the world who share our passion and dedication to making knowledge public.

Our staff, services, and software have all changed over the years, but one thing remains the same: we are, and will always be, an academic project that develops and supports open infrastructure to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing. Join us as we look back at our top stories from 2019-2020. Discover what it means to us to be truly open.
