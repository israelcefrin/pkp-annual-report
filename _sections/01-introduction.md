### Our Story

The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) was established in 1998 as a research project. Years before “open access” was coined, PKP was trying to solve the problem of cost as a barrier to creating and consuming scholarship online. Our team of scholars and students pursued this goal for nearly three years before, in 2001, Open Journal Systems (OJS) was born.

Today, OJS is the world’s most widely used open source (free) publishing software, available in more than 25 languages. We owe this success to our contributors – past, present, and future – whether they be librarians, software developers, translators, editors, scholars, and many more from around the world who share our passion and dedication to making knowledge public.  

Our staff, services, and software have all changed over the years, but one thing remains the same: we are, and will always be, a research and development project that creates and supports open infrastructure to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing. Join us as we look back at our top stories from 2019-2020. Discover what it means to us to be truly open.

> “When it comes to ‘open’ in the academic context of access to research, data, infrastructure, and educational resources, what we’ve been learning over the last two decades is how important it is to be continually working on the spirit and the details of that openness. It’s not just unlocking the door, and you’re done. It is not just allowing everyone to download software and you’re open. The challenge and excitement of continually working on open – open to whom; open to what; open for what reasons; open by what means – keeps us engaged and committed.” <cite>&ndash; **John Willinsky**  <br/>Founder and Director, Public Knowledge Project</cite>

> “Community oversight ensures PKP will never be acquired by a commercial publisher and that it will continue to operate in the best interests of the academy and global scholarship. The PKP Advisory Committee provides community input on general strategic directions, priorities, and the ongoing development of PKP’s organizational structures and governance. As a project that is non-profit, university-based, and academic-led, PKP needs to demonstrate and operate sufficiently, effectively, and responsibly. The Advisory Committee helps to ensure this happens. Community infrastructure is more than a tagline - it is simply how PKP operates.” <cite>&ndash; **Allan Bell**  <br/>PKP Advisory Committee Chair <br/>Associate University Librarian, Digital Programs and Services, University of British Columbia</cite>

> “SFU works with communities, organizations, and partners to create, share, and embrace knowledge that improves lives and generates real change. PKP is an important part of this work. That the world’s most widely used open source software for disseminating open knowledge is developed here at SFU is both a privilege, and an opportunity.  The use of OJS in the classroom, for example, has provided real world experiences for our students while giving them a voice, and platform, to address societal issues. Furthermore, open access publishing plays an important role in knowledge mobilization and movements towards greater inclusivity, diversity, and equity in scholarship. This is a new era of potential, and I look forward to what more PKP has to offer both our institution, and the world.” <cite>&ndash; **Joy Johnson**  <br/>Incoming President, Simon Fraser University (SFU)</cite>
