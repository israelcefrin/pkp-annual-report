Thanks to OJS, we have been able to support a growing number of faculty and student publications since 2005. Offering this service is part of the UTL's strategic priorities. It builds strong and enduring collaboration with faculty, students, staff, our consortial partners at the Ontario Council of University Libraries, and the Canadian scholarly communication community at large, and it fosters evolving research and scholarly publishing approaches that encourage sharing, inclusiveness, and knowledge creation.”  <cite>&ndash; **Larry P.

### Events

PKP both offers, and attends, conferences, events, and workshops around the world. In 2019, our team was invited to present workshops in Indonesia ([HEBII International Workshop for Journal Editors](https://indonesianeditor.org/index.php/news/item/71-international-workshop-for-journal-editors)) and South Africa ([UCT-SPARC Africa Open Access Symposium](https://www.sparcafricasymp.uct.ac.za/)).

By far our biggest event was PKP 2019, our bi-annual International Scholarly Publishing Conference co-hosted by the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) November 18-22, 2019. In addition to a two-day sprint, the event included six workshops, five keynote speakers, and 32 presentations attended by 164 participants from 25 countries.

We also held three development sprints. In May, PKP held a pre-conference sprint as part of the Library Publishing Forum at Simon Fraser University (Canada). Then in July, the University of Pittsburgh (USA) hosted a three-day sprint. Our final sprint, as mentioned above, was in Barcelona (Spain) for PKP 2019. Sprints are free, fun, and interactive events for community members to brainstorm important tasks, set priorities, and work collaboratively. Participants don’t just talk about improvements: in 2019, PKP sprints made direct and real-time contributions towards documentation, user testing, accessibility, XML, metadata, and more.

### Strategic Partners

[Strategic Partners](https://pkp.sfu.ca/strategic-partners/) include institutions, publishers, and other agencies that have an ongoing consultative relationship with PKP and closely aligned strategic goals. Collaborative activities are wide ranging and may include: collaboration on research projects; development contributions; provision of language translations; assistance with software documentation, learning material or technical support; joint workshops, seminars or conference presentations; and participation in software testing. In 2019, three new strategic partners joined PKP: [4Science](https://www.4science.it/), [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), and [Open Academia](https://www.openacademia.net/).

### Community Forum

The [PKP Community Forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/) is more than just an online discussion board. It is a gathering place, a source of knowledge, and a safe space for inquiring minds. Participants come from all over the world, from all types of professions, and bring a range of skills and abilities. In 2019, trending topics included DOIs, themes, plugins, and upgrading.
