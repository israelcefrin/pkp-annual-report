We lead by example in supporting open access, open source, open data, and open educational resources. At the heart of our own open learning and research practices is the Public Knowledge Project (PKP). From our work in Digital Publishing, hosting OJS journals for students and faculty, to our latest project, SFU’s Knowledge Mobilization Hub, we understand first hand the value of making knowledge public. This shared vision - what it means to be open - is the reason why we continue to serve as PKP’s administrative home, providing human resources, financial, and legal support.” <cite>&ndash; **Gwen Bird** <br/>Dean of Libraries, SFU Library, Simon Fraser University</cite>

### SCOSS

The [Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services](https://scoss.org/) (SCOSS) was formed in early 2017 with the purpose of providing a new coordinated cost-sharing framework for enabling the broader open access (OA) and open science (OS) community to support the non-commercial services on which it depends. In its pilot funding cycle, more than 1.5 million euros were been pledged by some 200 institutions worldwide to help secure the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ) and [SHERPA Ro/MEO](http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php).

In 2019, SCOSS launched its second funding cycle. PKP was selected as one of three vetted services – along with the [Directory of Open Access Books](https://www.doabooks.org/) (DOAB)/[Open Access Publishing in European Networks](https://www.oapen.org/) (OAPEN) and [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net/) – to be presented to the SCOSS international scholarly community for funding.

SCOSS selected PKP because of our ambition to scale up our hosting and publishing services. [PKP Publishing Services](https://pkpservices.sfu.ca/) was created in 2007 to cross-subsidise the development of our open source software. In order for these services to continue to offer a sustainable future, we need to expand and grow our business acumen. Our fundraising goal is to raise €734,647 towards operational costs including marketing and business development.

<!-- For 2020-2021, our focus is on the following three key priorities:

{:.list .list--three-col .list--numbered}
1. **Long-term financial sustainability**
2. **Community engagement**
3. **User needs, accessibility, and usability** -->
