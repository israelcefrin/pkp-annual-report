### Coalition Publica

[Coalition Publica](https://www.coalition-publi.ca/) is a partnership between long-standing collaborators [Érudit](https://www.erudit.org/) and PKP to establish a national infrastructure dedicated to the digital production and dissemination of research results in the Canadian humanities and social sciences (HSS). It is funded by two [Canadian Foundation for Innovation](https://www.innovation.ca/) grants: Major Science Initiatives Fund (2017-2022) and Cyberinfrastructure Initiative (2017-2020).

Coalition Publica is focussed on three key activities: **1)** developing a support program for Canadian scholarly journals in the humanities and social sciences; **2)** aligning Érudit and PKP’s technological developments to create a national production, dissemination, and research infrastructure offering a comprehensive range of scholarly publishing services to the Canadian community; and **3)** organizing research activities focused on the evolution of the scholarly publishing sector.

In 2019-2020, Coalition Publica’s national campaign was a great success: the annual objective to include 20 new journals was reached very quickly and a waiting list was established for 2021. The team also recognized the need for a holistic Digital Object Identifier (DOI) strategy, developing a Metadata Working Group in 2019 to achieve two main deliverables: **1)** a best practices guide for OJS metadata for journals, and **2)** a report to PKP and Érudit with technical recommendations to improve metadata quality in their respective systems.

### Institutional Hosting

In 2019, [PKP Publishing Services](https://pkpservices.sfu.ca/) piloted an Institutional Hosting package with the University of British Columbia and the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries. Designed specifically for libraries, the package offered multi-journal hosting and support services to meet the specific needs of higher education institutions, along with free and unlimited student journals. The idea came from the realization that we were uniquely situated to support larger institutions, both in expertise and experience. Upon analysis, we also realized we were able to provide volume-based discounts based on size. Now offered widely, the Institutional package is available to universities and colleges who wish to have hosting support for five or more journals. Hosting is free for student and course-journals provided they have faculty representation to ensure some level of continuity.

### Community Support

As our community grows, so too does our expertise. PKP staff and community members are available online when you need help, have a question, or just want to reach out. PKP offers free online support via the [PKP Community Forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/) (discussion board), [PKP Docs Hub](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/) (user guides and developer documentation), and [PKP School](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/) (open, self-paced courses).

From April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, the PKP Docs Hub (launched in 2018) continued to thrive, including visits from 178 countries:
