intro: "When PKP was founded, a major barrier to connecting the academy to the larger world was restricted access to research through print publications and subscription paywalls. Our research continues to identify those barriers, providing solutions and proposing models that facilitate open access on a global scale."

### Copyright Reform

John Willinsky is on a mission. He’s building a case for legal reform and has embarked on a two-year investigation to prove that American copyright law violates the U.S. Constitution. Copyright, he’s discovered, is a barrier to open science - and he’s willing to take on Congress to change such.

In October 2019, Willinsky [was awarded a grant for $165,000 from the Arcadia Fund](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/new-grant-to-stanford-university-graduate-school/) to investigate the potential of copyright reform in support of open access. His argument is that American copyright law can be shown to be currently impeding the progress of science now that scholarly publishing’s stakeholders agree that open access is best for science.

Willinsky has been consulting with legal scholars, copyright lawyers at university and public libraries, publisher representatives, and government officials to assess the feasibility and potential structure of such legal reforms. He is assembling relevant precedents, legal arguments, and operating mechanisms for initializing legal reform within his [latest book draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjulpetHpvOs1EcWtOGv0RCPgST0Y8AvooP97COOnbg/edit?usp=sharing), “Copyright’s Constitutional Violation.” As his work continues into 2020-2021, the hope is that these efforts will garner support for legislative change; change that begins in the U.S. and spreads from there, enabling greater public access to research and lasting educational benefits for students, professionals, and the interested public.

### [Subscribe-to-Open]

{:.patterned-bg}
In 2017, PKP’s John Willinsky proposed the following idea in a blog post: What if we tapped into research libraries’ strong support for open access by asking them to subscribe to open access? Libraries would pay fees to journals that they were already subscribing to and in exchange, the journals would flip to open access. Working with Libraria, a collective of researchers based in the social sciences, John’s vision has now become a reality. In 2019, Libraria joined forces with Berghan Books to create a pilot project and on January 22, 2020, Berghan Open Anthro was launched: 281 libraries have subscribed, 13 titles are being flipped to open access, and there are no article processing charges (APC) or embargos in sight.
