intro: "For more than twenty years, PKP has been developing software that improves and adapts with the changing scholarly publishing ecosystem. In 2016, PKP reached a major milestone with the release of OJS 3.  A shared web application library and several significant improvements to our UI/UX soon followed. In 2019, these two development areas continued to play an important role in the ongoing evolution of our software."

> “&hellip;OJS has survived (and even thrived) in an often dire-looking funding climate. It has survived because it addresses a very real need on the part of its large user base, one recognized not just by its users, but also by funding institutions, libraries, universities, and advocacy groups. OJS, having been originally conceived as a strategic intervention into the world of journal publishing, now shapes a significant portion of that world.” <cite>&ndash; [Mind the Gap, 2019]</cite>
